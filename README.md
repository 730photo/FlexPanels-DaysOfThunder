# FlexPanels-DaysOfThunder

This was the 5th project from the #JavaScript30 that i've completed.
I made a Flex Gallery with my own photography of NBA Players.
When you click on an NBA player within 1 of the 3 Flexboxes, it expands to 5x its size and the players full name transitions from the top and from the bottom.

Things I learned:
<ul>
  <li>-Flexbox with CSS</li>
  <li>-Transitions with CSS</li>
  </ul>

Goals:
<ul>
<li>-Make mobile responsive</li>
  </ul>
